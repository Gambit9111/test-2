The healthcare sector is witnessing a digital revolution, thanks to IoT. Connected devices are enabling continuous monitoring of patient health, leading to more proactive and personalized care.

Wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers monitor vital signs in real-time, providing valuable data for both patients and healthcare providers. This continuous monitoring can lead to early detection of potential health issues, improving patient outcomes.

IoT devices are also enhancing patient care in hospitals. For example, smart beds can monitor patient vitals and movements, alerting staff to potential issues. Additionally, IoT-enabled medical equipment ensures timely maintenance, reducing the risk of malfunctions.

As IoT technology continues to evolve, its integration into healthcare promises to improve patient care quality, efficiency, and accessibility.
