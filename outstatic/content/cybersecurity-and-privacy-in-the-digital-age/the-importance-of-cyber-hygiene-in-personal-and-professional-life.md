Cyber hygiene refers to the practices and steps that users of computers and other devices take to maintain system health and improve online security. Good cyber hygiene is crucial in both personal and professional contexts to protect against threats like malware, phishing, and identity theft.

One of the fundamental aspects of cyber hygiene is regularly updating software and applications. These updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities.

Another key practice is using strong, unique passwords for different accounts and considering the use of a password manager. Additionally, enabling two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security.

In a professional context, cyber hygiene also includes regular backups of important data and training employees on recognizing and responding to cybersecurity threats.

By practicing good cyber hygiene, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to cyber attacks and protect their sensitive data.
